It is hard to find something when there is an instant current gone situation in our home or in a place where you might think if there is an application where the flash will automatically turn on itself when there is darkness around you don’t even manually need to do

Suppose You are home and fixing something in your garage, somehow light’s gone and the first thing you might want is your phone more importantly this application will automatically turn on the flashlight when there is darkness around from your device

Yes there is indeed an extra feature while working in your home or office, you might be connected through wifi what you can do is set up the timer from the application as to how much longer you want your flash on It will instantly turn on when the wifi leaves or disconnected in other words there is no current in your place in case if you don’t want the flash you can just turn off the switch
